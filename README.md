## 📋 What is microgpt-visualizer?

microgpt-visualizer is a simple application that lets you see how a basic GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model works. It shows the process visually, so you can watch the inner parts move and connect. The app uses an autograd engine to help explain how the model learns and changes.

This tool is useful if you want to understand how GPT models work in a clear and interactive way. It is designed for anyone curious about machine learning and artificial intelligence, even if you don’t have programming experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section helps you download, install, and start using microgpt-visualizer quickly.

### Step 1: Download the software

Visit the release page using this link:

[![Download microgpt-visualizer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Here-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Antonel098/microgpt-visualizer/releases)

This page contains the latest version of the software ready for your computer.

### Step 2: Choose your version

On the release page, you will see download files for different operating systems. Pick the file that matches your computer:

- For Windows: a file ending in `.exe` or `.zip`  
- For macOS: a file ending in `.dmg` or `.zip`  
- For Linux: usually a `.AppImage` or `.tar.gz` file  

If you’re unsure which version you need, check your computer’s system information or ask someone familiar with your device.

### Step 3: Download the file

Click the file for your system to start the download. The file size should be about 10-50 MB. Wait until the download finishes before moving on.

### Step 4: Install the application

- **Windows**:  
  - If you downloaded an `.exe` file, double-click it to run the installer and follow the prompts.  
  - If you downloaded a `.zip` file, unzip it and look for the `.exe` file inside to start the program.  

- **macOS**:  
  - If you downloaded a `.dmg` file, double-click to open it then drag the app into your Applications folder.  
  - If you downloaded a `.zip` file, unzip it and move the app to Applications.  

- **Linux**:  
  - For `.AppImage` files, you may need to make it executable. Right-click the file, select Properties, and check "Allow executing file as program." Double-click to run.  
  - For `.tar.gz` files, unpack the archive and follow any instructions inside.  

### Step 5: Run microgpt-visualizer

After installing, open the application:

- On Windows or macOS, find it in your Start menu or Applications folder.  
- On Linux, run the application file or from your application launcher.  

You should see the main interface with a clear layout to explore the GPT visualization.
